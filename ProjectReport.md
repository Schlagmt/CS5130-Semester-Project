# Project Report

## Project Description

For this semester project I focused on the study and recreation of the tests performed in the academic paper ["RESTest: Automated Black-Box Testing of RESTful Web APIs"](https://personal.us.es/amarlop/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RESTest-Automated-Black-Box-Testing-of-RESTful-Web-APIs.pdf). RESTest is a Java based application that is designed to provide a more precise form of testing RESTful APIs. It takes in a [OpenAPI Specifications (OSA)](https://swagger.io/specification/) file and is able to create a test configuration file for the endpoints listed in the file. This test configuration file can then be edited by the developer to create more in depth and specific test cases for the API. RESTest can be run in a variety of different forms, including the primary options of random based testing and constraint-based testing, which makes use of the custom values defined in the test configuration file. These tests can be displayed and examined through custom Allure web pages that are built at run time.  

Personally, I chose this project because of the growing demand for APIs in web development. In my last co-op rotation, I spent the majority of my time learning, designing, and implementing a RESTful API. A major part of this process is designing and building tests to assure the API is functioning properly. The prospect of an automated tool has the potential to save a large amount of time and effort. However, this process must be thoroughly checked and built upon to assure its functionality and reliability in practice.  This project will focus on the recreation of tests published in the preceding academic paper to assure the quality of the RESTest tool. Any differences between the reported and observed results will be subject to discussion and further investigation.
